 **🎯 What I Learned**

While working on this project, I learned how to:

* Translate a static design into a real web page

* Pay attention to spacing, typography, and alignment

This challenge helped reinforce the importance of **visual accuracy** and **responsive design principles**.

I overcame these by testing frequently and adjusting styles based on visual comparison.
